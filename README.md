The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence.
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ……..

In mathematical terms, the sequence Fn of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation



 

    Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
with seed values

   F0 = 0 and F1 = 1.


Given a number n, print n-th Fibonacci Number.
Examples:

Input  : n = 2
Output : 1

Input  : n = 9
Output : 34
Recommended: Please solve it on “PRACTICE ” first, before moving on to the solution.
Write a function int fib(int n) that returns Fn. For example, if n = 0, then fib() should return 0. If n = 1, then it should return 1. For n > 1, it should return Fn-1 + Fn-2
